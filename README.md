# Features

My take on LearnWell:

Sign in with any user ID to access the videos for that user.

Once logged in, there are a few main features on the website:

Homepage: The homepage displays all of a user's uploaded videos along with their respective titles. Click on any video title to open that particular video's card. This will allow you to see the comments, description, make a comment, edit the video, as well as control playback speed, volume, and fullscreen.

Watch Videos: The videos can be watched directly from the homepage or inside their video card.

Upload a New Video: To upload a new video, click on the upload (cloud) icon in the top right corner of the screen. Enter your title, description, and video URL. Press submit to uplaod your video.
